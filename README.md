Continous integration with Jenkins 
Continous integration is reason to generate a shorter release cycles for the clients and also it is way to get automation in the release process. 

Code to continous integration tool which will build and run tests and then gives and feed back if needed to the deveoper or else do the release automatically. Reducing the release risk with faster delivery of the finished product.

```

### Jenkins Master Slave architecture 

create two slaves in aws 

slave1 and slave2 

these servers can be managed from master node 

### CICD pipline 

get project from https://github.com

install docker on both the slaves 

configure Jenkins to build the project and Slave1 if successfull then build on slave2


Finally, trigger the job using git web-hooks : an event which automatically triggers the pipeline 

Jenkis > create a job > in slave1 > link repository
