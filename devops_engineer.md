# DevOps Key Notes
### Key Phrases and terms 

People over process over tools : emphasize priority

Continuous delivery (Release in small batches)

Lean Sofware Management (Focus on Lean)

Change Control : operational success and change controll

Ifrastructure as code : The whole process should be treated as code

###  10 practical practices for devops 

1. Incident command system
2. Developer on call (involvement)
3. Status pages public status pages (banner message)
4. Blameless portmortoms (review)
5. Embedded teams (sharing)
6. The Cloud -- use cloud -- api driven way .. allows you to treat your infrastructue as code 
7. Andon Cords ( Innovation used by toyota, stop ship on production line, quality control system and stop the pipeline)
8. Dependency Injection -- Loosely coupled dependencies pass dependencies at run time ..
9. Blue green deployment ( two identical system, blue and green )
10. Chaos monkey (netflix )

### How to pick devops tools 

i. Programmable

ii. Verifiable
 
iii. Wellbehaved 

## Building blocks of DevOps 
AGILE : 

SDLC to AGILE development precursor to DevOps introduction 

AGILE's missing piece is System Operations 
Hence Devops is extension of AGILE system. 

LEAN : 

Lean Software Development 
Enhanced feedback loop 
Muda, Muri, Mura (Japanese terms to define ?)
Seven Waste of Software Development (google ?)

ITIL, ITSM, SDLC


are being replaced by DEVOPS 

## Infrastructure Automation 
Infrastructure as code 

Configuration Management

CM toosl are meant for following 

Provisioning -- prepare 

Deployment  -- deploy

Orchestration -- manage 

### Approaches  
imperative,
declarative,
idempoten -- repetition, 
self service,
Canary Deployment, 
Blue/ Green Deployment, 
Immutable Deployment(netflix),

Immutable Deployment ?? 
Deb file ?? 

### Continuous Delivery 

Small + Faster = better 

Continous Integration Practices 

Continuous Delivery mean : 
artifacts should be build once and then immutable 
have same built artifact to all the environments 
dev 
stage and prod 
Keeping track of metrics for furthering in making better 

Role of QA
Don't forget testing 
Code hygiene 
Integration testing 
TDD, BDD, Acceptance driven development 

CICD Tools: 
Version Control : GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket 

CI: Jenkins, GoCD, Bamboo

BUILD TOOL :
Maven 
Gulp

Unit Test 
Linters, JUnit
Cucumber ...

Infra test 
Kitchen CI 

Reliability: 
Metrics to improve and increase reliability 

Circuit breaker 

APM tools ?? 
Code Profilers ?? 

Metrics and Monitoring 
Service Metrics 
System Component Metrics 
Application Metrics 


TOOLS
